# The Chandrian

### Songs

* There are seven, some say 3 or 5 one says 13

* blue flame, crazy animals, a man with black eyes or all 3

* cold to the touchfires don't burn around them'yoked to shadow'


### Cobb

* Where do they come from?Where do they go after they've done their bloody deeds?Are they men who sold their souls? demons? spirits? no one knows

### Jake

* The first 6 people to refuse Tehlu's choice of the pathcursed to wander the corners

### Townfolk

* touch iron or tip your beer when you hear them mentioned

### Ben

* There are seven, _Chaen_ means 7_Chaen-dian_ means '7 of them' in Temic

* Come like lightning from a clear blue sky. Just destruction. No rhyme or reason to it.

* blue flame is a sign but may not be exclusive

* One has eyes like a goat or no eyes or black eyes

* Plants die when they are around, wood rots, metal rusts, brick crumbles

* shadows point the wrong way, toward the light

* '_something_ the shadow-hamed'

* he is afraid of saying their names aloud, saying he's being careful

* none of the songs and stories are humorous


### Kvothe's mother

There may be one sign per member

### Kvothe's first encounter

* Iron rusted, Wood rotted

* Unfamiliar men and women

* The fire was tinged with blue


**Cinder**:

An effortless and supple tumbler \/ swordsmanMoved like mercury

Sword pale and elegant, cut the air with a brittle sound like the quiet that settles on the coldest days in winter when it hurts to breathe and everything is still

Narrow and sharp face with the perfect beauty of porcelain

shoulder length hair framing his face in loose curls the color of frost

a creature of winter pale, everything about him was cold and sharp and white, except his eyes black like a goat's, but with no iris his eyes were like his sword neither reflected the light of the fire or the setting sun

perfect ivory teeth

**bald man:**

* had a grey beard

* **"Lord" Haliax:**

* A man who sat apart from the rest wrapped in shadow at the edge of the fire

* seemed to command the others

* The shadow surrounded him despite the sunset and firelight

* shadow was thicker around his head where he wore a deep cowl similar to what some priests wear

* Led by a purpose

* Cinder is a tool in his hand

* When he says "Ferula" Cinder's body goes rigid with pain

* knows the inner turnings of Cinder's name

* "who keeps you safe from the Amyr? The singers? The sithe?"

* believes his group is too fond of their cruelties

* does not always accompany the group

* seeking something, wishing to achieve something

* looked up toward the sky as did the rest of the group

* said "they come"he wrapped them in his shadow and they vanished
