## The Chandrian Incident

Sixteen days after a storm the troupe stops at a 'threeweight oak' tree fallen on the road. Kvothe's mother sends him out for sage. When he returns they're all dead. Kvothe then meets the Chandrian. The Chandrian are scared off by some sign of another group.

Kvothe collects the Rhetoric book and his father's lute accidentally burning down his parents' wagon in the process. He runs off into the forest. He dreams he is with Laclith, Abenthy, and his Father going over their lessons. He treats his torn bloody hands with Motherleaf. Slept against a Laystone.

He goes about his survival preparations like an automaton. He manages to collect together enough resources for survival. The extra time allotted to him from being prepared re-awakens his mind. Even in this state he still played his lute
