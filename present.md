The 5 return the next night in a poor mood. They talk of rumors. The town starts buying iron.

### Some time around then

Chronicler is mugged by 6 ex-soldiers

Graham presents Kvothe with a mounting board made of roah labeled \_folly., \_which Kote had requested 4 months earlier. Kvothe seems more dull\/wilted than a month prior. He has Bast grab his sword from under his bed. They mount it on the board.

A large group of travelers come to the inn, eat and stay the night. One traveler recognizes Kvothe from Imre after hearing him sing. He says he saw where Kvothe killed "him" in Imre. Kvothe asks bast to knock the traveler out. Then tells Bast casually mention a story he provided him.

Kvothe finds himself staring into space with his hands in his lap one curled around the other

Kvothe asks the smith for rod-iron \/ pig-iron. He takes a 2 foot long piece like the rest of the town has and asks for an apron and a set of forge gloves. He leaves a note for Bast "If you read this I am probably dead".

Chronicler stops at a farm halfway to Newarre. He sees Kvothe at a bonfire in the ruins of a house. Neither recognize the other. Chronicler smells burning hair and rotting flowers \(burnt scraeling\) coming from the pot on the fire. Kvothe has the iron rod and gloves from the previous scene.. Kvothe tells him the scraeling are coming. He gives Chronicler a piece of firewood and tells him to hit them, fall on them, or throw them in the fire. Chronicler is attacked first and knocked himself out on the wall behind him.

When Chronicler awakes, Kvothe asks for help digging a pit. He agrees then promptly passes out. Kvothe revealed that he had received several cuts and continued digging the pit. He then caries Chronicler back to the Waystone.

Bast seems to not recognize Chronicler when he arrives. They put him to bed. Bast cleans and sews Kvothe's wounds.

Bast sneaks in later when Kote seems asleep

he checks:

* cheek color
* breath smell
* forehead
* wrist
* hollow of the throat above the heart

The next day Chronicler describes his journey to Kvothe and calls him out as being Kvothe, not Kote. The sword on the wall makes him anxious. Kvothe tells Chronicler that he has put him in danger by coming here. Chronicler asks to hear his story, goading him by saying the rumors about him are not pleasant. Kvothe agrees saying it will require 3 days. Chronicler protests, but Kvothe offers veiled threats about leaving if Chronicler tries to come back or not letting Chronicler leave at all.

The day after Chronicler shows Kvothe his phonetic symbols. Kvothe begins to tell his story to chronicler. Kvothe chides Bast for eavesdropping. Chronicler recognized Bast for what he is. He attacks using the name of iron. Bast prepares to attack in return but Kvothe stops him.. They are forced to make up and shake hands. Kvothe serves them a green liquid \(presumable alcohol\) and they continue listening to his story

Kvothe finished the story of his parents passing. Bast showed Chronicler the bruise he got from Kvothe tellin him not to mention it. Kvothe collected firewood, wept, then returned to the story.
