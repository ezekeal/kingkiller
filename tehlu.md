**Origin \(by Trapis\):**

Between 400 and 1000 years ago there were famines and plagues and wars and other bad things \(death?\). Demons also walked the land. The worst was Ecanis. Tehlu watched the world of men. He saw the tragedy but only saved a few. Because he saves only the worthy, and not many were. Tehlu was unhappy, his church was corrupt...Or there was no church and no priests. Eventually he saw a woman named Perial of pure heart and spirit. He came to her and told her she was the only good person. She asked if he could help her neighbors. He told Perial about their sins; cheating, drinking, beating. She said that the hard world had made them so and she would still help all of them if she could. So he put a baby in her, magic style. In three months she gave birth to Menda who grew to manhood in 2 months. The townfolk led by the town smith Rengen went to her door and demanded to see the child or they would burn her house, fearing he was a demon child. Menda claims to be Tehlu and tells the people he has come to save them from demons and their own wickedness. He draws a line and asks them to follow in his path or theirs. The smith crossed first and was beaten with a hammer then Tehlu gave him a new name and took some but not all of the pain away. Others followed some had demons who ran out after being hit. Seven stayed on the other side of the line. Tehlu jumped across the line and struck them hard. The fourth was a demon who he crushed in his hands, cursing its name, sending it to the outer darkness. Tehlu did not speak to or embrace the six. He did this in many towns. One demon Encanis always eluded him. Wherever Tehlu stopped to offer choices Encanis had been there right before wrecking shop. After seven years Tehlu had walked the world he had driven out all but Encanis. As Tehlu was catching up Encanis wrecked a city to slow him down, but Tehlu only stopped to appoint priests to help. Encanis destoryed six cities in six days, Tehlu was too close so the seventh city was saved. On the eight day Felling Tehlu did not sleep or eat, he caught up to Encanis and hit him with his hammer. Encanis fell and the hammer was shattered. On the 9th day he brought the demon to Atur. Tehlu forged an iron wheel. It was taller than a man with six spokes each thicker than a hammer's haft. It's name was terrible and none could speak it. He had a priest dig a pit 15ft wide by 20ft deep. They filled the pit with evergreens and lit them. On the 10th day he chained the demon to the iron wheel. Tehlu slept as the demon writhed against the iron. He gave the demon the same choice but he declined. So he tossed him in the fire. The demon broke his arms free after a time. So Tehlu jumped in and held him down burning alongside him.
