# Lanre

---

**Young Kvothe:**

* Lanre was a prince or a king, someone important

* He wanted to be more powerful than anyone else in the world

* He sold his soul for power but something went wrong after

* He went crazy, or couldn't sleep, or something


**Abenthy:**

* He didn't sell his soul.

**Skarpi**:
* a man who lost his eye and gained better sight
