**Cinder**:

An effortless and supple tumbler \/ swordsmanMoved like mercury

Sword pale and elegant, cut the air with a brittle sound like the quiet that settles on the coldest days in winter when it hurts to breathe and everything is still

Narrow and sharp face with the perfect beauty of porcelain

shoulder length hair framing his face in loose curls the color of frost

a creature of winter pale, everything about him was cold and sharp and white, except his eyes black like a goat's, but with no iris his eyes were like his sword neither reflected the light of the fire or the setting sun

perfect ivory teeth



**bald man:** 

* had a grey beard

* **"Lord" Haliax:**

* A man who sat apart from the rest wrapped in shadow at the edge of the fire

* seemed to command the others

* The shadow surrounded him despite the sunset and firelight

* shadow was thicker around his head where he wore a deep cowl similar to what some priests wear

* Led by a purpose

* Cinder is a tool in his hand

* When he says "Ferula" Cinder's body goes rigid with pain

* knows the inner turnings of Cinder's name

* "who keeps you safe from the Amyr? The singers? The sithe?"

* believes his group is too fond of their cruelties

* does not always accompany the group

* seeking something, wishing to achieve something

* looked up toward the sky as did the rest of the group

* said "they come"he wrapped them in his shadow and they vanished

**Origin \(by Trapis\):**

Between 400 and 1000 years ago there were famines and plagues and wars and other bad things \(death?\). Demons also walked the land. The worst was Ecanis. Tehlu watched the world of men. He saw the tragedy but only saved a few. Because he saves only the worthy, and not many were. Tehlu was unhappy, his church was corrupt...Or there was no church and no priests. Eventually he saw a woman named Perial of pure heart and spirit. He came to her and told her she was the only good person. She asked if he could help her neighbors. He told Perial about their sins; cheating, drinking, beating. She said that the hard world had made them so and she would still help all of them if she could. So he put a baby in her, magic style. In three months she gave birth to Menda who grew to manhood in 2 months. The townfolk led by the town smith Rengen went to her door and demanded to see the child or they would burn her house, fearing he was a demon child. Menda claims to be Tehlu and tells the people he has come to save them from demons and their own wickedness. He draws a line and asks them to follow in his path or theirs. The smith crossed first and was beaten with a hammer then Tehlu gave him a new name and took some but not all of the pain away. Others followed some had demons who ran out after being hit. Seven stayed on the other side of the line. Tehlu jumped across the line and struck them hard. The fourth was a demon who he crushed in his hands, cursing its name, sending it to the outer darkness. Tehlu did not speak to or embrace the six. He did this in many towns. One demon Encanis always eluded him. Wherever Tehlu stopped to offer choices Encanis had been there right before wrecking shop. After seven years Tehlu had walked the world he had driven out all but Encanis. As Tehlu was catching up Encanis wrecked a city to slow him down, but Tehlu only stopped to appoint priests to help. Encanis destoryed six cities in six days, Tehlu was too close so the seventh city was saved. On the eight day Felling Tehlu did not sleep or eat, he caught up to Encanis and hit him with his hammer. Encanis fell and the hammer was shattered. On the 9th day he brought the demon to Atur. Tehlu forged an iron wheel. It was taller than a man with six spokes each thicker than a hammer's haft. It's name was terrible and none could speak it. He had a priest dig a pit 15ft wide by 20ft deep. They filled the pit with evergreens and lit them. On the 10th day he chained the demon to the iron wheel. Tehlu slept as the demon writhed against the iron. He gave the demon the same choice but he declined. So he tossed him in the fire. The demon broke his arms free after a time. So Tehlu jumped in and held him down burning alongside him.
