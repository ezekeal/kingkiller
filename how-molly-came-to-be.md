# How Old Holly Came to Be

[_set in the four corners_](http://blog.patrickrothfuss.com/2013/06/a-new-story/)

In the beginning there was the wood

by a stream

tower

climbing vines bad

wind neutral

the lady neutral, came to tower, made a garden, cut other trees burned in garden

She did not cut the Holly Tree

climed the tree read books, neutral

moon is light and dark

man is both light and dark

came to the tower, they were both beneath the tree

sang to the lady, they both left the tower

garden grew left untended changed, garden was no more

tower left untended did not change and stayed

Holly grew, stay, did not change

lady game to the tower

cut a branch for a wreath, bad

rooted the vines cut from branches, good

sat beneath the holly and the moon and wept, neutral

she sang beneath the holly, good

sang good

left the tower, bad

holly changed, both good and bad

stream, wind, birds beautiful

lady sat beneath the tree and read, good and beautiful

lady turned her ankle bad

lady sang to tree, branch became a walking stick, good

picked herself on the thorns, bad

lady sang and holly spread down the stream and around the tower

holly grove was good

wind was bad 

holly bent

smoke on the sky 

shapes moving across the hills

great black wolve mouths of fire

men bent halfway into birds

they were both and bad

shadow bent to look as if it were a man

shapes came closer

she said

Old holly became a man, he was both, and it was good

lady sang

New holly bent and became a spear and it was good

Old holly took the spear

old holly struck the wolves 

he tore the men bent into birds and tore them apart

the ground shrunk away from the shadow thing

spear wood of lving green, blade bright as berry blood

struck the shadow thing and watched it die and this was good

lady said she must leave

said that she would return

said for Holly to stay here with the tower for her return

lady went inside the tower, came outside, said goodbye

made her a walking stick of green wet wood

made a crown of bright red berry

roof and glass of the tower left, the bones of the wolves left

old holly stayed

the stream left, the tower left, old holly stayed
