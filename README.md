## In the Troupe - The beginning of Kvothe's story

_Kvothe facts unless otherwise noted_

Kvothe is 11 years old. His Edema Ruh troupe arrives in Wydeconte Hills. They are forced to play the square. The mayor warns against the vulgar or heretical, that there are god -fearing folk here. The last troupe had 2 fights stole laundry and knocked up one of Branston's daughters. After talking with the council the mayor allows them to use the public house. Abenthy arrives in town. The mayor tries to kick him out, but Abenthy calls the wind and turns them around. Abenthy meets Kvothe and offers his services to the troupe. Abenthy explains Arcanists to Kvothe and agrees to teach him

### End of Summer

Kvothe overhears his parents talking about the Chandrian.

### End of Spring

Kvothe binds the air in his lungs to the air outside in an attempt to call the wind. Abenthy looks into his eyes calls the wind to help him. Kvothe is a month shy of twelve. Abenthy slows his lessons, stops alchemy and withholds sygaldry. Ben receives an offer in Hallowfell to stay with a young Brewer's widow, tutor her son, and help run the brewery.

The troupe held a combined 12th birthday for Kvothe and going away for Ben. Kvothe received a knife from trip, cloak from shandi, and a lute from his parents

## The Chandrian Incident

Sixteen days after a storm the troupe stops at a 'threeweight oak' tree fallen on the road. Kvothe's mother sends him out for sage. When he returns they're all dead. Kvothe then meets the Chandrian. The Chandrian are scared off by some sign of another group.

Kvothe collects the Rhetoric book and his father's lute accidentally burning down his parents' wagon in the process. He runs off into the forest. He dreams he is with Laclith, Abenthy, and his Father going over their lessons. He treats his torn bloody hands with Motherleaf. Slept against a Laystone.

He goes about his survival preparations like an automaton. He manages to collect together enough resources for survival. The extra time allotted to him from being prepared re-awakens his mind. Even in this state he still played his lute

## Alone in Tarbean

### End of Autumn

Kvothe finally heads out from the woods after breaking 3 strings on his lute. He heads north \(the sun on his left shoulder after half a day\). He gets picked up by Seth and Jake and dropped off in Tarbean.

He runs into a gang of kids led by Pike. Pike beats him up, the lute is smashed in the process. A city guard chases them off and steals Kvothe's one copper and 2 shims as payment.

### One month later

Kvothe had been begging rather unsuccessfully, and stealing even less so.

He discovers Trapis and his home for lost children. He visits for food and to help out with decreasing frequency in the first few months.

He slowly found out how to scavenge for food and had a secret place atop an old tannery.

### Midwinter

Kvothe goes begging in Hillside Tarbean. He manages to get a silver penny from a woman there. A shopkeep tells a guard and the guard beats the crap out of him causing him to loose his silver penny. He makes it back to Waterside near death. A man in the Ecanis mask and a woman in a green mask find him. They seem to be on the run from an incident that they didn't cause but might get blamed for. He gives Kvothe a silver talent and his gloves. He limps to an Inn where he buys a blanket and some food and wine. After a day or so he made his way back to Trapis with the remaining coin. Trapis nursed him back to health using his money to buy necessary medicine.

### Three years later

Kvothe age 15 and no longer in Tarbean. \(stub\)

_narrator facts unless noted otherwise_

### Two years prior to Chronicler's arrival

Kvothe starts teaching Bast.

### One year prior

Kvothe shows up in Newarre. Cobb, Graham, Jake, Shep, and the Smith's prentice visited the Waystone every felling night for months.

### The Waystone Inn - Autumn - a year or so later

The roads have gotten worse than usual people aren't traveling much without many guards

A trader visits the town charging abnormally high prices for goods that are in tight supply. He left a couple hours later. Kvothe claims the trader reported scrael in Melcombe.

### Two span later

It's Cendling Night, a moonless night. Something bad happened on Shep's farm.

On Felling Night. Carter reports the attack on him and his horse two miles outside of town. It Killed his horse and jumped on him.

Cobb tells the story of Taborlin to the other 4 regulars. Carter comes in face smeared with blood looking scared with a thing wrapped in a blanket. His shirt was covered in straight cuts. Reveals the thing is a spider long as a wagon wheel black as slate

Kvothe tests the scrael by pressing an iron shim to it which creates a short crack\/pop.

Kvothe gives Carter 48 stitches.

Townfolk take the scraeling to a priest. Kvothe says he did the right things for all the wrong reasons. Kvothe keeps a piece to draw the rest out.

After the patrons leave he cleans the bar

Bast shows up with soup and is surprised Kote \/ Reshi is late for their lessons. Kote tells Bast about the scraeling which upsets him.

The 5 return the next night in a poor mood. They talk of rumors. The town starts buying iron.

### Some time around then

Chronicler is mugged by 6 ex-soldiers

Graham presents Kvothe with a mounting board made of roah labeled _folly., _which Kote had requested 4 months earlier. Kvothe seems more dull\/wilted than a month prior. He has Bast grab his sword from under his bed. They mount it on the board.

A large group of travelers come to the inn, eat and stay the night. One traveler recognizes Kvothe from Imre after hearing him sing. He says he saw where Kvothe killed "him" in Imre. Kvothe asks bast to knock the traveler out. Then tells Bast casually mention a story he provided him.

Kvothe finds himself staring into space with his hands in his lap one curled around the other

Kvothe asks the smith for rod-iron \/ pig-iron. He takes a 2 foot long piece like the rest of the town has and asks for an apron and a set of forge gloves. He leaves a note for Bast "If you read this I am probably dead".

Chronicler stops at a farm halfway to Newarre. He sees Kvothe at a bonfire in the ruins of a house. Neither recognize the other. Chronicler smells burning hair and rotting flowers \(burnt scraeling\) coming from the pot on the fire. Kvothe has the iron rod and gloves from the previous scene.. Kvothe tells him the scraeling are coming. He gives Chronicler a piece of firewood and tells him to hit them, fall on them, or throw them in the fire. Chronicler is attacked first and knocked himself out on the wall behind him.

When Chronicler awakes, Kvothe asks for help digging a pit. He agrees then promptly passes out. Kvothe revealed that he had received several cuts and continued digging the pit. He then caries Chronicler back to the Waystone.

Bast seems to not recognize Chronicler when he arrives. They put him to bed. Bast cleans and sews Kvothe's wounds.

Bast sneaks in later when Kote seems asleep

he checks:

*  cheek color
*  breath smell
*  forehead
*  wrist
*  hollow of the throat above the heart

The next day Chronicler describes his journey to Kvothe and calls him out as being Kvothe, not Kote. The sword on the wall makes him anxious. Kvothe tells Chronicler that he has put him in danger by coming here. Chronicler asks to hear his story, goading him by saying the rumors about him are not pleasant. Kvothe agrees saying it will require 3 days. Chronicler protests, but Kvothe offers veiled threats about leaving if Chronicler tries to come back or not letting Chronicler leave at all.

The day after Chronicler shows Kvothe his phonetic symbols. Kvothe begins to tell his story to chronicler. Kvothe chides Bast for eavesdropping. Chronicler recognized Bast for what he is. He attacks using the name of iron. Bast prepares to attack in return but Kvothe stops him.. They are forced to make up and shake hands. Kvothe serves them a green liquid \(presumable alcohol\) and they continue listening to his story

Kvothe finished the story of his parents passing. Bast showed Chronicler the bruise he got from Kvothe tellin him not to mention it. Kvothe collected firewood, wept, then returned to the story.
