## Alone in Tarbean

### End of Autumn

Kvothe finally heads out from the woods after breaking 3 strings on his lute. He heads north \(the sun on his left shoulder after half a day\). He gets picked up by Seth and Jake and dropped off in Tarbean.

He runs into a gang of kids led by Pike. Pike beats him up, the lute is smashed in the process. A city guard chases them off and steals Kvothe's one copper and 2 shims as payment.

### One month later

Kvothe had been begging rather unsuccessfully, and stealing even less so.

He discovers Trapis and his home for lost children. He visits for food and to help out with decreasing frequency in the first few months.

He slowly found out how to scavenge for food and had a secret place atop an old tannery.

### Midwinter

Kvothe goes begging in Hillside Tarbean. He manages to get a silver penny from a woman there. A shopkeep tells a guard and the guard beats the crap out of him causing him to loose his silver penny. He makes it back to Waterside near death. A man in the Ecanis mask and a woman in a green mask find him. They seem to be on the run from an incident that they didn't cause but might get blamed for. He gives Kvothe a silver talent and his gloves. He limps to an Inn where he buys a blanket and some food and wine. After a day or so he made his way back to Trapis with the remaining coin. Trapis nursed him back to health using his money to buy necessary medicine.

Kvothe learned to pickpocket, steal, run from sweet-eaters, and make shoes from rags

### Twoish years later

Kvothe saw pike again and followed him back to his "secret place" in Dockside. He stole his beer and cheese and a shirt. He also found charcoal drawings of a woman's face. Kvothe set his place on fire. Pike stabbed him in the thigh, broke his ribs, gave him a black eye and threatened to kill him as he ran away. Kvothe set a trap for him and set him on fire.

### Another years later

Kvothe age 15 now

He ovearhears a girl in Trapis' basement talking about a storyteller. Kvothe sees the storytelller \(named Skarpi\) and hears the story of Lanre.cccc
