## Alone in Tarbean

### End of Autumn

Kvothe finally heads out from the woods after breaking 3 strings on his lute. He heads north \(the sun on his left shoulder after half a day\). He gets picked up by Seth and Jake and dropped off in Tarbean.

He runs into a gang of kids led by Pike. Pike beats him up, the lute is smashed in the process. A city guard chases them off and steals Kvothe's one copper and 2 shims as payment.

### One month later

Kvothe had been begging rather unsuccessfully, and stealing even less so.

He discovers Trapis and his home for lost children. He visits for food and to help out with decreasing frequency in the first few months.

He slowly found out how to scavenge for food and had a secret place atop an old tannery.

### Midwinter

Kvothe goes begging in Hillside Tarbean. He manages to get a silver penny from a woman there. A shopkeep tells a guard and the guard beats the crap out of him causing him to loose his silver penny. He makes it back to Waterside near death. A man in the Ecanis mask and a woman in a green mask find him. They seem to be on the run from an incident that they didn't cause but might get blamed for. He gives Kvothe a silver talent and his gloves. He limps to an Inn where he buys a blanket and some food and wine. After a day or so he made his way back to Trapis with the remaining coin. Trapis nursed him back to health using his money to buy necessary medicine.

### Three years later

Kvothe age 15 and no longer in Tarbean. \(stub\)
