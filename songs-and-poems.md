# Songs and Poems

## Tinker Tanner

* A sing-along with a bunch of verses

* A drinking song older than God


## A song that applies to scraelings

_Let me tell you what to do_

_dig a pit that's ten by two_

_ash and elm and rowan too_

## The chandrian children's song

_When the hearthfire turns to blue_

_what to do? what to do?_

_run outside. run and hide._

_When his eyes are black as crow_

_where to go? where to go?_

_Near and far. Here they are._

_See a man without a face_

_move like ghosts from place to place_

_What's the plan? What's the plan?_

_Chandrian. Chandrian._

## Alriden's Lanre

_Sit and listen all, for I will sing_

_A story, wrought and forgotten in a time_

_Old and gone. A story of a man._

_Proud Lanre, strong as the spring_

_Steel of the sword he had at ready hand._

_Hear how he fought, fell, and rose again,_

_To fall again. Under shadow falling then._

_Love felled him, love for native land,_

_And love of his wife Lyra, at whose calling_

_Some say he rose though doors of death_

_To speak her name as his first reborn breath._

## Lady Lackless

_Seven things has Lady Lackless_

_Keeps them underneath her black dress_

_One a ring that's not for wearing_

_One a sharp word, not for swearing_

_Right beside her husband's candle_

_There's a door without a handle_

_In a box, no lid or locks_

_Lackless keeps her husband's rocks_

_There's a secret she's been keeping_

_She's been dreaming and not sleeping_

_On a road that's not for traveling_

_Lackless likes her riddle raveling_

## Bast song

_How odd to watch a mortal kindle_

_Then to dwindle day by day_

_Knowing their bright souls are tinder_

_And the wind will have its way_

_Would I could my own fire lend_

_What does your flickering portend?_

## **Below the walls**

* Written by Kvothe's father the same way he pieced together his final song

## **Feilor's Fall**

1. Claims 13 Chandrian on in each pontifet in Aturn and and extra for the Capitol

## **Kvothe's Parents Sing**

**Mother:**

_In evening when sun is setting fast_

_I'll watch for you from high above_

_The time for your return is long since past_

_But mine is ever-faithful love_

**Father:**

_In evening when the light is dying_

_My feet at last are homeward turning_

_The wind is through the willows sighing_

_Please keep the hearthfire burning_

## **The Ballad of Ben, Brewer Supreme**

* Written by Kvothe's troupe for Ben's going away

## **Greystones**

_Like a drawstone even in our sleep_

_Standing stone by old road is the way_

_To lead you ever deeper into Fae_

_Laystone as you lay in hill or dell_

_Greystone leads to \[something something\] 'ell'_

___Whatever the season_

_That I'm on the road_

_I look for a reason_

_Loden or laystone_

_to lay down my load_

## **The Lay of Sir Savien Traliard**

* by Illien, considered to be his crowning work

* hellishly complex

* a tragedy, makes Kvothe cry every time


## **The Pontifex Always Ranks under a Queen**

* Written by Kvothe and his mother while coming up with rhymes for the more nonsensical etiquette

## Kvothe's lyricless songs

* Warm Grass and Cool Breeze

* Wind Turning a Leaf

* Sun Setting Behind the Clouds

* Bird Taking a Drink

* Dew in the Bracken

* Riding in the Wagon with Ben

* Singing with Father by the Fire

* Watching Shandi Dance

* Grinding Leaves When it Is Nice Outside

* Mother Smiling

* Waiting While it Rains

* Snow Falling with the Late Autumn Leaves

* Calloused Fingers on a Lute with Four Strings
